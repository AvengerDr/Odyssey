In order to take advantage of the supplied _Oddysey.proj_ build script you will need to change the SharpDXSdkBinDir at the top of the file so that it points to the _Bin_ folder of your SharpDX SDK. Use the supplied _net45_ (for Desktop projects) or _Win8Debug_ (for WinRT) configurations to build the project.
